# A/B_Analysis
 This repo features analysis and findings of an A/B group dataset.

 ## Analysis
Utilizing power pivot along with minor formula use, I created multiple visulizations to allow for insights between a control group and a test group to 
analyse both the postive and negative trends in changing a button of the website. In addition, I also focus on the test group trends in different visulizations 
extrapolate overall performance as well as actionable changes that could potentially be made.
