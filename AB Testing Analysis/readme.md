## Introduction 

Utilizing Excel and its power pivot functinality, I broke down results in an A/B testing dataset that features both a control group and a test group for the changing of a button on a website. Pivot charts and minor formulas are also utlized to showcase varies differences, outliers, and trends, within different aspects of the resulting data. 

### A/B Analysis File

### Excel Skills Used
- **Pivot Table**
- **Charts**
- **Power Query**
- **Data Validation**
- **Formulas**

### Dataset
This dataset contains the results of end-user behavior, split between a control group and test group. Features of the dataset include:
- **A & B groups**
- **Clicks per User**
- **Unqiue User IDs**

## Analysis

**Clustered Column Charts**

![Formula](https://github.com/Billy-Shelton/AB-Testing-Analysis-Project/blob/main/.Pictures/Screenshot%202025-05-02%20211235.png)

- **Design Choice:** Using a cluster coloumn chart for ease of A & B comparison, I show the precentage difference between the two for immediate clarity of data, as well as postive or negative trending between the two groups. To show an increased difference of total engagement, a formula was utilized to calculate and implement the +12.8% increase for the test group, to allow exact understanding of the different results beetween the control group vs test group.
- **Insights Gained:** An immediate callout from the data is that the test group is preforming at an increased engagement then the control group. Potentially meeting expectations that were set beforehand.
- **Opportunities for Improvements:** Adding onto the left vertical axis a defined scale to account for total numbers of end-users between both groups.

- **Design Choice:** A Cluster Coloum chart was utilized here to allow for ranking and ease of data clarity for the end-user. The total precentages of each ranking displays over their unqiue coloumn for ease of comparison and actinable insights.  
- **Data Organization:** On the left vertical axis I have postioned the total clicks vs 100% of the userbase, using the bottom axis to compile unique users based on amount of clicks. Utilizing both, I am able to show a breakdown that showcases test groups retention and engaement vs the button change.
- **Insights Gained:** While there is a high rate of one click-users, there is a dramatic drop off when moving over to our two click-users, however there is less of a drastic drop off between two click and three click-users. Further investigation into the retention of those blocks of users could provide actionable insights for improvements that could convert our one click-users into the caste of our returning userbase.
- **Opportunities for Improvements:** The title of the chart does not accurately convey the intent and breakdown of the chart, causing potential confusion in the data. Updating to reference that the precentages are a breakdown of 100% of the userbase would allow for better understand and clarity of the data presented.


**Pie Chart**

- **Design Choice:** I Utilizied a pie chart to allow for immediate understanding and actionable planning, as well as allowing for further planning into differences in data vs expectations of the stakeholders. Using pivot tables, I also implemented the statistical difference between the two groups for data clarity.
- **Insights Gained:** Currently in the test group, there is a large portion of untapped end-users that the button change is failing to engage with. Further research into how to meet the engagement needs of these users could allow for actionable planning and implementations to reach these users.
**Opportunities for Improvements:** The chart title does not allow full clarity of the data, not showcasing it is solely focused on the test group. Changes to this would allow for full data clarity and visual understanding.

**Stacked Coloumn Chart**

- **Design Choice:** The use of a stacked bar chart allows for easy data clarity between the two comparisons in each bar. This fully utilizes the space of the chart with the intent to not overwhelm with the data. The further support this the specific percentages of each stack where placed at the top of each bar, matched to color. This was done for heightened clarity and understanding of the visuals. 
- **Data Organization:** Views were placed first, at the bottom of each stacked bar, to show unengaged end-users and potential for growth. The top half of the stacked bars was clicks, showing overall success as well as potential points to expand on for growth.
- **Insights Gained:** When looking at the chart, we can see that the new button has met the eyes of a fair amount of users but hasn't engaged them to click on it. Following over to bar two, there is actually an large engagement of 1 time clicks from end-users. A revaluation of the button may be needed to encourage clicking, as well as further engagement afterwards. 
- **Opportunities for Improvements:** The title of the chart does not accurately reflect the data shown, in that it does not state the test group is the one being focused on. Improving the title to reflect the intent of the data shown should should be the first step towards better clarity.

**Enhanced Data Validation:**
